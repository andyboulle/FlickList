# FlickList - Movie Tracker

FlickList is a user-friendly iOS app designed to help you keep track of the movies you want to watch and the ones you've already seen. With FlickList, you can easily manage two distinct lists: a "Watched" list and a "Want to Watch" list. Additionally, when you mark a movie as watched, you have the opportunity to give it a numerical rating. The app also allows you to edit or remove movies from either list, ensuring a personalized and organized movie-watching experience.
